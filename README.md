## GOMOKU - CONNECT FIVE


### Background:

![Game Layout](/gomoku/images/overall.png)

Go-moku is a traditional Japanese strategy board game which dates back to the 17th century. *Go* translates to five and *-moku* translates to pieces. This naming convention is reflected in other Asian countries as well. In China, it is called 五子棋 (wu-zi-qi); in Korea, it is known as 오목 (o-mok).


This rendition of Go-moku pays homage to traditional and modern styles of the game. It offers multiple game formats, allowing players to customise the playing board ('Go-Board') size and the types of rules ('Freestyle' or 'Tournament'). That way, both the casual and competitive strategy games player can enjoy this ubiquitous game.

### Technologies Used:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript - VanillaJS

### Instructions 
Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken line of five stones of their color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. See examples of victories below.

![Vertical Win](images/vertical-win.png)
![Diagonal Win](images/diagonal-win.png)

If the board is completely filled and no one can make a line of 5 stones, then the game ends in a draw.

## Next Steps:
Future iterations of the project may include the following:
* Timer wherein players have a 10 minute time limit to make all their moves.
* Additional winning logic to disallow victories where six or more pieces are in line (known as the 'overline' rule)
* Audio for when buttons are clicked, pieces are set, and victory is achieved 
* Play against a CPU
